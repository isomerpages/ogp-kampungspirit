<h2>Social Worker Testimonials</h2>
<h3>Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore, Family Service Centre</h3>
<p>"Kampung Spirit has been a helpful platform for us, social workers, to
fulfill our clients’ ad-hoc needs. My clients who have benefitted from
the platform are thankful for the swift and generous public donors. It
has also been very convenient for social workers to tap on the platform,
as the delivery efforts are well-coordinated by the OGP team." - <strong>Hayley Hoe, Social Worker (FRCS FSC)</strong>
</p>

<p>“It is easy for me to put up my request. The response time in getting
the request approved and knowing that the item will be delivered to the
client is fast. I am not sure if it is due to the CNY period. I did not
expect the request to be expedited so soon. This has enabled me to move
on to attend to other clients and focus on my other tasks.” - <strong>Aidil Ahmad, Assistant Senior Counsellor (FRCS FSC)</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Kampung Spirit is a meaningful &amp; great initiative as it offers opportunities
for SSAs to advocate for new item or service for clients – which is a rare
resource. Jan &amp; his team have been very prompt from implementing their
plan to fulfilling the requests raised by us. Kudos to the OGP team! Hope
that KS can continue to run for a long time in addressing the gap for us
to better serve the community in need!” - <strong>Stephanie Lai, Community Partnership Manager (FRCS FSC)</strong>
</p>
<h3>Allkin</h3>
<p>“KampungSpirit has been a great platform for me to gather resources for
the beneficiaries. Through this platform, I managed to meet two requests
from my beneficiaries, which have greatly benefited them. The items are
not only essential to meet their daily needs but also uplift their quality
of life. A big thank you to Jan and his team for the prompt updates, and,
most importantly, generosity and heart for the community. We are truly
very thankful for this opportunity! - <strong>Mabel Ng, Allkin Family Service Centre @ Sengkang</strong>
</p>
<h3>NTUC First Campus Co-operative Ltd</h3>
<p>“We are truly thankful for the genuine and speedy help from Open Government
Products. My client felt very assured and grateful for the support that
was rendered when she needed it.” - <strong>Kyra Annemarie Das, NTUC First Campus Co-operative Ltd</strong>
</p>
<h3>Fei Yue Community Services</h3>
<p>“Jan from Kampung Spirit is very proactive and efficient in following
up and ensuring that the item purchased is suitable for my client. This
new resource has been beneficial to my client and her family.” - <strong>Sherlyn Chan, Fei Yue Community Services</strong>

<h3>Kampong Kapor Community Services</h3>

for our client’s needs. The coordination is seamless and process is hassle-free!"

<h3>Thye Hua Kwan FSC</h3>
<p>“Kampung Spirit initiative is a&nbsp; meaningful initiative. I was pleasantly
surprised when Jan reached out to me regarding my client's request, as
I did not expect it to be fulfilled so promptly. The donation has benefited
my client, who is facing financial struggles. We are truly grateful for
Jan and his team and donors. I hope that the Kampung Spirit initiative
can continue, enabling more individuals and families in need to benefit.”
